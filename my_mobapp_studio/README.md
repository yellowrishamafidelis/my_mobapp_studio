Thanks!
## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The challenge is to perform an in-depth market analysis of mobile applications available on the Google Play Store. The goal is to generate insights on market size, category distribution, app popularity, and pricing, which will aid in strategic decision-making for a new mobile app.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
To solve the problem, the approach involves:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Implementing functions to load and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing various analyses including:

1 Summary statistics
2 Distribution of downloads and prices across categories
3 Correlation analysis
4 Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts. 

Visualization: Creating visual representations of data to identify trends and insights, such as the most popular paid apps and genres in the Family category, and the average price per category.
## Installation
 How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To set up the project, you will need:

1 Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2 Required Python packages can be installed using pip. Create a requirements.txt file and include necessary packages like pandas, matplotlib,   seaborn, etc.

Example requirements.txt:

Copy code
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
To install the dependencies, run:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
 How does it work?
```
1 Load the dataset: Implement the load_dataset() function to load data from the provided file.
2 Analyze the data:
  Use print_summarize_dataset(dataset) to get an overview.
  Clean the dataset using clean_dataset(dataset).
  Generate histograms with print_histograms(dataset).
  Compute the correlation matrix using compute_correlations_matrix(dataset).
  Plot scatter matrices with print_scatter_matrix().
  
3 Generate Reports:
 Visualize the most popular paid apps and genres.
 Compare the number of installations and average prices per category.
 Identify the most expensive apps by category.
 To execute the analysis and visualization, run the Jupyter notebook and ensure that all functions are correctly implemented.
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
